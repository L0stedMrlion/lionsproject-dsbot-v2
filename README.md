# 🦁 Lion's Project - Discord bot

Discord bot for our project named 🦁 Lion's Project! This bot is gonna be multi-purpose, because we need some bot to tell information.

This is my first discord.js v14 bot I ever made. Im just begginer and Im trying to learn new things. I remaked this bot maybe like 3 times now and I need to make a final version of working bot.
